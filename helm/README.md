# Helm chart for Aerospike on Kubernetes

Implements a dynamically scalable Aerospike cluster using Kubernetes StatefulSets.


## Usage:

1. Before installing the chart, copy all the files [config/](configs/) directory including `feature-key-file` to `files/` directory. These files are necessary to create configMap object.

2. Install the chart.

```sh
helm install --name aerospike ./
```

You can also set the configuration values as defined in `values.yaml` using `--set` option.
For example, 

```sh
helm install --set dBReplicas=5 --name aerospike-release ./
```

### Output:

```sh

```
Note that the directory name and Chart name must match.
